# Fortnite Stats

This 'fortnite' component is a Home Assistant custom sensor which shows you various stats accumulated while playing the very popular F2P game, [Fortnite: Battle Royale](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home). 

## Why?

It can show you how well you're playing the game with stats like:
- How many kills you've earned
- Kill/Death Ratio
- Kills Per Game
- Total Matches Played Per Mode
- Your Fortnite Score
- Your Score Earned Per Match
- Your Win Ratio

And how many times you finish in the:
- Top 1
- Top 3
- Top 5
- Top 6
- Top 10
- Top 12
- Top 25

## Purpose

This is my first Home-Assistant Custom Component, so it's been a fun learning experience for me contributing to Open Source Software! This wouldn't been possible without the help from @xcodinas for building the fortnite-python library and from @clyra for helping refine my initial script and idea by further developing it towards a more finished product. From there I've added some extra tweaks, wrote the documentation, and published it in the Home-Assistant Community Store (HACS).

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Show stats pulled from fortnite API on https://fortnitetracker.com

## Manual Installation

Download the fortnite.zip file from the latest release.
Unpack the release and copy the custom_components/fortnite directory into the custom_components directory of your Home Assistant installation.
Configure the fortnite sensor.
Restart Home Assistant.

## Installation via HACS (Preferred Method)
Ensure that HACS is installed.
Search for and install the "fortnite" integration.
Configure the fortnite sensor in `configuration.yaml`.
Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration is done in YAML -> `configuration.yaml` 

My username is Captain_Crunch88 and I play on the Nintendo Switch (use "GAMEPAD" in the config) if you want to test out the sensor. You'll need to register for an api key at https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api

<!---->

````yaml
sensor:
  - platform: fortnite
    name: Fortnite Solo Stats
    api_key: 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-lmnopqrstuvw
    player_id: Captain_Crunch88
    game_platform: "GAMEPAD"
    game_mode: "SOLO"
  - platform: fortnite
    name: Fortnite Duo Stats
    api_key: 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-lmnopqrstuvw
    player_id: Captain_Crunch88
    game_platform: "GAMEPAD"
    game_mode: "DUO"
  - platform: fortnite
    name: Fortnite Squads Stats
    api_key: 12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-lmnopqrstuvw
    player_id: Captain_Crunch88
    game_platform: "GAMEPAD"
    game_mode: "SQUAD"
````

If you play on multiple platforms, you'll need to create multiple sensors for each platform you play on. For example if you play on the PC and Nintndo Switch, you'd use `PC` in one sensor and `GAMEPAD` in the other sensor. At this time there is no aggregate sensor, but maybe you can submit a pull request for a Template Sensor in Home Assistant to aggregate it!


Game Platform | Config Value (ALL CAPS!)
-- | --
PC | `PC`
Xbox | `XBOX`
PlayStation | `PSN`
iPad & iPhone | `TOUCH`
Nintendo Switch | `GAMEPAD`
KBM | `KBM`
